RSS feed for cryptome.

This python script will output an .xml RSS file. Put this on your server, add a cronjob/crontab to automatically request new content.
The rss feed is based upon regular expressions, so if www.cryptome.org changes the HTML code, this may not work anymore.

Installation:

1) Chmod +x rsscryptome.py
2) ./rsscryptome.py
3) Output RSS format in cryptnews.xml
4) Put cryptnews on your server, put URL in rss reader.
5) Done, eat some peanuts :-)
